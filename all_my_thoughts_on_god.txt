I believe Jesus is God.

But I don't believe in miracles.

Allow me to explain.

Who is God?  What is God?

Well, I know it will be controversial, but I believe that God is actually Goddess.  Goddess is Gaia.  God is Mother Earth.  Goddess is Love,  Goddess... just Is.  In any system of thought, there must be an ultimate starting point that cannot be explained.  I call this ultimate starting point God.  I call this ultimate starting point Goddress.  

Now, let's talk about this God or Goddess or... Goddexx.  This I AM I AM.  How could we get to know It?  Well, we have to take some leap of faith, in some direction.  I propose the following: God is Love.  With this presupposition, we can get closer to explaining why we're here, and what we ought to be occupying our time with.

My main goal in this essay is to convince you that we can all get along.  We can bring peace to the Middle East.  We can usher in a golden age.  We just have to respect Reality, and crucify our egos frequently.

Suppose that God is Love.   What is Love?  Love is caring about others more than oneself.  Love is exactly what you know it to be.  It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

So we have some idea of what Love is and what God is.  Now, what is this Fall?  I believe that it happened approximately two billion years ago

What is the story of the Garden of Eden really about?  Whether you interpret the event to be literal and historical or allegorical, there are obviously messages in it.  So, the snake is the tempter. The apple is the temptation.  The female human is the seduced.  And the male human is also the seduced.  Then God is dissapointed.

This is a short summary of the story of The Fall.  Now, what's going on here.  What are the messages?

I believe that the Fall happened 2.0 billion years ago.
